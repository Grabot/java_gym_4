The challenge
-------------------------------



How to join
-------------------------------

* Clone this project. If you use IntelliJ, choose file > new > project from version control -> github. Enter the url you find at the top of the page.
* Implement the class `src/main/java/javagym/Solution.java`_ to solve the puzzle. Make sure the tests pass!
* If you want to commit your code and you have a Github account, you can 'fork' this project and commit to that.
* Sometimes the challenge code is fixed or more tests are added. If that happens:

    * If you created a fork: ``git pull https://github.com/java-gym/java_gym_X master`` where ``X`` is the challenge number.
    * If you checked out the code without fork: ``git pull``.
