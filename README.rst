Java gym challenge
===============================

Welcome to the next Java Gym challenge!

The challenge
-------------------------------

The fourth Java Gym challenge is to solve a maze. But not just any maze - a maze that changes with time.

But it's not all bad:

- The mazes are only two-dimensional, not counting time.
- You know beforehand how the maze will change.
- You can run as far as you want before between changes.

The solution with the fastest runtime wins (which is not necessarily the one with the shortest path).

How to join
-------------------------------

* Clone this project. If you use IntelliJ, choose file > new > project from version control -> github. Enter the url you find at the top of the page. Add as Maven project when prompted.
* Implement the class `src/main/java/javagym/Solution.java`_ to solve the puzzle. Make sure the tests pass!
* If you want to commit your code and you have a Github account, you can 'fork' this project and commit to that.
* Sometimes the challenge code is fixed or more tests are added. If that happens:

    * If you created a fork: ``git pull https://github.com/java-gym/java_gym_X master`` where ``X`` is the challenge number.
    * If you checked out the code without fork: ``git pull``.
